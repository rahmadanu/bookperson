    description: "Penerapan metode JOYFULL LEARNING untuk menggapai dan meningkatkan HOTS (Higher Order Thinking Skills) anak, HOTS merupakan sebuah konsep dari Benjamin S. Bloom yang tertuang dalam bukunya yang berjudul Taxonomy of Educational Objectives yang telah diterapkan berpuluh-puluh tahun lalu sampai sekarang di negara-negara maju. Itulah mengapa negara maju sangat maju dalam bidang pendidikan dan menjadi mercusuar dalam pendidikan, sedangkan faktanya Indonesia peringkat 72 dari 77 negara dirilis Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Metode JOYFULL LEARNING bukan hanya bisa meningkatkan HOTS anak akan tetapi bisa mengasah berbagai kecerdasan yang ada pada anak. Tidak hanya itu dengan metode ini anak juga bisa mendapatkan Skill Abad-21 yang sangat diperlukan untuk bisa menjadi sukses dalam kehidupan. Metode ini sangat powerfull dan sudah dijadikan kurikullum wajib di SD di negara-negara maju, Saya sendiri sudah bertahun-tahun menerapkanya dan hasilnya banyak terlahir anak-anak bertalenta yang bisa menjuara kejuaran tingkat Asean. Tahun 2020 ini saya bersama yayasan yang saya dirikan (Yayasan Sakata Innovation Center) mendapat kepercayaan dari Kemendikbud untuk menerapkan metode ini ke berbagai puluhan sekolah dasar di Indonesia lewat program POP-Kemendikbud yang akan dimulai tahun 2021. Ebook ini Saya rilis untuk anda para orang tua yang ingin mengajarkan anaknya tentang coding, memang pada dasarnya belajar coding perlu bimbingan tutor ahli, buku ini bisa menjadikan anda seorang tutor ahli coding. Ebook ini adalah bagian dari Coding Series yang mengajarkan anda tentang coding scratch dari basic atau awal. Anda akan dibimbing mulai dari megenal scratch, mengenal tools-tools atau bagian dari scratch sampai mengimplementasikannya membuat sebuah animasi atau game sederhana. Ebook ini sangat cocok bagi anda yang petama kali mengenal scratch atau bahkan pertama kali mengenal pemrograman. Bagi anda yang ingin bisa mengajar dan membimbing anak belajar coding, Ebook ini sangat cocok untuk dipelajari. Bahkan anak-anak pun bisa mempelajarinya langsung dari Ebook ini, karena disajikan secara step by step dari awal sampai bisa membuat sebuah game.",

You need have no previous knowledge of any computer programming language so it's ideal for the newcomer, including youngsters needing to learn programming basics for the school curriculum. Coding for Beginners in easy steps instructs you how to write code to create your own computer programs. It contains separate chapters demonstrating how to store information in data structures, how to control program flow using control structures, and how to create re-usable blocks of code in program functions. There are complete step-by-step example programs that demonstrate each aspect of coding, together with screenshots that illustrate the actual output when each program has been executed. Coding for Beginners in easy steps begins by explaining how to easily create a programming environment on your own computer, so you can quickly begin to create your own working programs by copying the book's examples. After demonstrating the essential building blocks of computer programming it describes how to code powerful algorithms and demonstrates how to code classes for Object Oriented Programming (OOP). The examples throughout this book feature the popular Python programming language but additionally the final chapter demonstrates a comparison example in the C, C++, and Java programming languages to give you a rounded view of computer coding. The code in the listed steps within the book is colour-coded to precisely match the default colour-coding of the Python IDLE editor, making it easier for beginners to grasp. By the end of this book you will have gained a sound understanding of coding and be able to write your own computer programs that can be run on any compatible computer.",
